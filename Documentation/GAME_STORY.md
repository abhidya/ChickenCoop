# Chicken Coop - The Game Story 🐔

## Overview: The Movie Script

*If Chicken Coop was a movie, this would be its screenplay...*

---

## ACT 1: A New Beginning

### SCENE 1: Dawn on the Farm

*FADE IN: A peaceful pastel-colored farm bathed in warm morning light. Soft ambient particles float through the air like golden dust motes.*

**THE FARMER** (our protagonist) stands in the center of a modest farm. They have **50 coins** jingling in their pocket - their life savings. Before them lies:

- 🌽 **A small corn field** - stalks swaying gently in the breeze, golden and ready
- 🐔 **A single chicken** - a cute, chibi-style hen with expressive eyes that blink and a body that gently bobs
- 🏪 **A market stall** - a simple wooden counter waiting for business

*The farmer looks at their meager resources, takes a deep breath, and begins their journey.*

---

### SCENE 2: The First Loop

**NARRATOR:** *"Every great fortune starts with a single kernel of corn..."*

The farmer approaches the corn field. With a satisfying **SQUASH** motion, they harvest their first ear of corn. Golden particles burst into the air!

**[GAME STATE: +1 Corn]**

*The farmer walks purposefully to the chicken coop, their footsteps leaving tiny dust puffs.*

They offer the corn to the hungry chicken. The hen pecks enthusiastically - **peck, peck, peck** - three adorable pecking motions.

**[GAME STATE: -1 Corn]**

*A moment of anticipation... The chicken squashes wider, then POP! An egg appears with a satisfying bounce animation!*

**[GAME STATE: +1 Egg]**

*The farmer carefully collects the warm egg, watching it glow and float upward as it enters their inventory.*

Now, to the market! The farmer places the egg on the counter...

**KA-CHING!** 💰

*Coins burst upward in a golden fountain!*

**[GAME STATE: +10 Coins]**

**NARRATOR:** *"And so the cycle begins - the eternal dance of corn, chicken, and commerce."*

## ACT 2: Growth & Expansion

### SCENE 3: The First Milestone

*TIME LAPSE: The farmer repeats the loop - harvest, feed, collect, sell. The coin counter climbs: 60... 70... 80... 90... 100!*

**[GAME STATE: 100 Coins - MILESTONE!]**

A new option appears, glowing with possibility:

**"HIRE HELPER - 100 Coins"**

*The farmer makes a decision. They spend their hard-earned coins...*

✨ SPARKLES ✨

*A new character appears in a burst of light! A **HELPER** - a slightly smaller, differently-colored farmhand ready to work!*

**[GAME STATE: Helper Count = 1]**

### SCENE 4: Automation Begins

*The Helper springs into action with a cheerful bob. They begin their eternal loop:*

1. 🏃 Waddle to corn field
2. 🌽 Harvest corn with a satisfying squash
3. 🏃 Waddle to chicken
4. 🐔 Feed the chicken
5. 🥚 Wait for and collect egg
6. 🏃 Waddle to store
7. 💰 Sell egg for coins
8. 🔁 Repeat forever!

**NARRATOR:** *"The farmer watches in wonder as coins begin flowing automatically. But this is just the beginning..."*
